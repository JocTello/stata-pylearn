{title:Description}
 
{pstd}
{opt pyforest} performs regression or classification with the random forest algorithm described by Breiman et al (2001). 

{pstd} In particular, {opt pyforest} implements the random forest algorithm as a wrapper around the Python modules sklearn.ensemble randomForestClassifier and sklearn.ensemble.randomForestRegression, distributed as components of the scikit-learn Python library.

{pstd} {opt pyforest} relies critically on the Python integration functionality introduced with Stata 16. Therefore, users will need Stata 16, Python (preferably 3.x), and the scikit-learn library installed in order to run.

{pstd} For more information on pyforest, refer to the pylearn GitHub page: {browse "https:/www.github.com/mdroste/stata-pylearn":https:/www.github.com/mdroste/stata-pylearn}.

 
{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}
 
{dlgtab:Main}
 
{phang}
{opth type(string)} declares whether this is a regression or classification problem. In general, type(classify) is more appropriate when the dependent variable is categorical, and type(regression) is more appropriate when the dependent variable is continuous.


{dlgtab:Random forest options}
 
{phang}
{opt n_estimators(#)} determines the number of trees used. In general, more is better. Default: n_estimators(100).

{phang}
{opt criterion(string)} determines the function used to measure the quality of a proposed split. Valid options for criterion() depend on whether the task is a classification task or a regression task. If type(regress) is specified, valid options are mse (default) and mae. If type(classify) is specified, valid options are gini (default) and entropy. 

{phang}
{opt max_depth(#)} specifies the maximum tree depth. By default, this is None.

{phang}
{opt min_samples_split(#)} specifies the minimum number of observations required to consider splitting an internal node of a tree. Default: min_samples_split(2).

{phang}
{opt min_samples_leaf(#)} specifies the minimum number of observations required at each 'leaf' node of a tree. Default: min_samples_leaf(1).

{phang}
{opt min_weight_fraction_leaf(#)} specifies the minimum weighted fraction of the sum of weights required at each leaf node. When weights are not specified, this is simply the minimum fraction of observations required at each leaf node. Default: min_weight_fraction_leaf(0).

{phang}
{opt max_features(string)} specifies the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Default: max_features(# of features/independent variables). Other options are max_features(sqrt) (the square root of the number of features), max_features(log2) (the base-2 logarithm of the number of features), an integer, or a float. If a non-integer is specified, then int(max_features,number of features) are considered at each split. 

{phang}
{opt max_leaf_nodes(#)} Grow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion, where best is defined in terms of relative reduction in impurity. Default: max_leaf_nodes is unconstrained (infinite).

{phang}
{opt min_impurity_decrease(#)} determines the threshold such tha a node is split if it induces a decrease in impurity criterion greater than or equal to this value. Default: mi_impurity_decrease(0).

{phang}
{opt nobootstrap} determines whether bootstrapped samples are used when building trees. If this option is specified, no bootstrapped samples are used, i.e. the whole dataset is used for each tree. By default, each tree uses data that is bootstrapped with replacement (same # of obs) from the original data.


{dlgtab:Training data options}

{phang}
{opt training(varname)} identifies an indicator variable in the current dataset that is equal to 1 when an observation should be used for training and 0 otherwise.
