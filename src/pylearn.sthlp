{bf: pylearn} is a set of Stata commands to perform supervised learning in Stata. These commands all exhibit a common Stata-like syntax for model estimation and post-estimation (i.e., they look very similar to regress). Pylearn currently includes five sets of models:

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp pytree R:pytree} estimates decision trees. {p_end}

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp pylearn R:pylearn} estimates random forests. {p_end}

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp pymlp R:pymlp} estimates multi-layer perceptrons (neural-networks). {p_end}

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp pyadaboost R:pyadaboost} estimates adaptive boosted trees/regressions (AdaBoost). {p_end}

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp pygradboost R:pygradboost} estimates gradient boosted trees. {p_end}

{title:Description}
 
{pstd}
{opt pylearn} is a package that provides estimation functionality for a set of supervised learning algorithms directly from Stata. These commands all share a common 'Stata-like' syntax that will feel very familiar Stata users. 

{pstd}
{opt pylearn} wraps around supervised learning implementations provided by the popular scikit-learn library in Python. This library has been extensively debugged by a large group of Python users. The implementations are relatively stable and efficient. All options available for these models in scikit-learn are available in Stata.

{pstd} 
{opt pylearn} relies critically on the Python integration functionality introduced with Stata 16. Therefore, users will need Stata 16, Python 3.6+, and the scikit-learn library installed in order to run.

{opt upgrade} upgrades pylearn to the latest release from the project GitHub page.

{phang}
{opt setup} checks to see whether the Python prerequisites for this package are satisfied.

{phang}
{opt examples} prints a few examples using pylearn commands.

{pstd}This program owes a lot to the wonderful {browse "https://scikit-learn.org/":scikit-learn} library in Python.
